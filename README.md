# React + Vite
# Tech Stack: ReactJS and Tailwind CSS

# Desrciption:
The Modern Landing Page is a fully responsive and visually engaging web application built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS.

# Tailwind-First Approach: 
All UI elements are styled using Tailwind CSS, allowing for rapid development and a highly customizable design. This utility-first CSS framework enabled me to create responsive layouts with ease while keeping the design consistent across different screen sizes.

# Responsive Design: 
The landing page is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, and desktop, providing a seamless experience for all users.

By combining ReactJS’s dynamic rendering capabilities and Tailwind CSS’s rapid UI development utilities, I was able to deliver a clean, professional-grade landing page that focuses on user experience and performance.
